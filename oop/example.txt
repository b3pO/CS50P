To obtain quality education, a small percentage of the students —either because they are unusually
gifted and can obtain scholarships, or because they come from wealthy families—go abroad. As a result, they are
tempted to adapt to foreign styles and modes of life, and even to remain abroad; in effect, they opt out of their
own society either by emigrating internally on their return, or simply by never returning. In 1967, for example,
26 per cent of the Chinese students studying sciences and engineering in the United States chose not to return to
Taiwan; for India the percentage was 21, and for Korea and Pakistan it was 15 and 13, respectively. It is a staggering 
fact that the underdeveloped countries supplied almost exactly one­half of the total number of engineers, scientists, 
and medical personnel who emigrated to the United States in the year ending June 1967: 10,254 out of 20,760.
